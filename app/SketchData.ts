  summary: `In this SNL sketch, Beth (played by Aidy Bryant) proudly shows off her newly painted living room to her brother Tom (played by Beck Bennett) and his wife Kristen (played by Kristen Stewart). She raves about the high-end British paint she used, Farrow&Ball, emphasizing its "unparalleled depth in colour" and how its 132 colors are perfect for homes both old and new. 
                
Tom and Kristen start to question the cost, leading to Beth reluctantly revealing the price as $110 per gallon. The revelation sparks tension, especially as Tom points out that Beth is unemployed and living in a rented house. Matters escalate when Johnny (played by Kyle Mooney), Beth's casual boyfriend whom she met on Facebook Marketplace, walks in asking for quiet. 
                
The sketch takes a sharp turn when Beth reveals that Tom's baby isn't actually his but the child of Kristen's personal trainer, leading to a physical fight between the two women. Despite the drama, Beth is still concerned that they don't ruin her expensive paint job during the fight. The sketch ends with a voice-over promoting Farrow&Ball, stating "each colour tells a story."`,
  notesAndTrivia:
    "In the Dry Fridays sketch Aidy uses the same 'What is your life?' line.",
